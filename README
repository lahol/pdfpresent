pdfpresent is intended as a simple presentation software for slides in PDF format.
The main idea is to provide to separate windows, one for the main presentation and one
for the so called console. There the current time and the current prerender status are shown.
Also there is support for notes (as optionally provided by the LaTeX beamer class) which
should be recognized automatically.

pdfpresent is released under a MIT license. See LICENSE for details.
